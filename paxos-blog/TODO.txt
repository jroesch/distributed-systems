TODO
----

1. Bringing old replicas up to speed
2. Repropose values after timeout
3. check that failure and proposal work correctly together
4. what happens if our proposal fails? we can try next instance, but we might get a weird ordering of events
5. allow proposal of multiple values to be turned on or off. also, does proposing multiple values actually need partial ordering?
6. TEST!!!
