# Readme 
I made the assumptions that the operations would remain in the range of the data structures, 
and did no handling of out of bounds exceptions.

I wrote my project in Scala and used its default build tools, and some of its standard libraries.

I included a launcher that will download the necessary JARs and launch the project completely self sustained
you should only have to do "./sbt run" in order to launch the project. That will launch a console that will
respond to your commands. My parsing was done literally so capitlization does matter with the commands.
